HttpGPT is an Unreal Engine plugin that facilitates integration with OpenAI's GPT based services (ChatGPT and DALL-E) through asynchronous REST requests, making it easy for developers to communicate with the chatbot. 

HttpGPT also includes Editor Tools to integrate Chat GPT and DALL-E image generation directly in the Engine.
